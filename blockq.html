<p>Here is a quote from Playstations website:</p>

<blockquote cite="https://blog.playstation.com/">
    New games announced at PS5 Showcase, including Final Fantasy XVI, Hogwarts Legacy, and a new God of War title
    Hoo boy! Last week was quite a ride, and we’re back with a new episode reflecting on the excitement coming out <br>
    of the PS5 Showcase, from the reveal of Final Fantasy XVI to a deeper look at Demon’s Souls combat. We also discuss <br>
    upcoming PS4 releases Crash 4, Star Wars: Squadrons, and chat about what we do when we’re in between playing big games.</blockquote>

<p>Done.</p>
